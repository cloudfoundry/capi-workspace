## CAPI Workstation Helpers üêã

Hello there! This repo is intended to help with development work on CAPI
projects.

![capi](https://im-01.gifer.com/9Y0s.gif)


## Directory Overview

Description of the folders in this project:

Folder           | Description
---------------- | -----------
assets           | random static files
bash-it          | all the [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) stuff, only bash-it stuff
helpers          | random helper files
lib              | scripts that could be sourced into your shell
bin              | scripts that can be added to your `$PATH`
install-scripts  | executable scripts that install a thing or two

Why is `lib` separate from `bash-it`? Not everyone uses bash-it, so `lib` is
similar to `scripts`, giving people a way to manually load the things they care
about in.

## Minimal Install

One may manually (and minimally) load in capi-workspace content by including
the following in their `~/.zshrc` (or equivalent):

```bash
source <(cat $HOME/workspace/capi-workspace/lib/*) > /dev/null
path+=("$HOME/workspace/capi-workspace/bin")
```

## CAPI Helper Commands

This table is generated from `assets/capidoc.yml`. It is dynamically available

## Using the Bosh Lite Pool

As a perk, [CAPI
approvers](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/app-runtime-interfaces.md)
get access to a pool of cf-deployment environments, deployed on bosh lites in a
CFF-managed IaaS account. These environments are displosable, and are only
intended for development use.

Though it is technically possible to use the pool without them, there are a
number of convenience scripts provided by capi-workspace that make the pool
usable by humans.

### Prerequisites

- git
- Clone capi-workspace (this repo)
- Add capi-workspace scripts/functions to your shell (see installation instructions above (or below))
- Clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-env-pool

### Example Pool Dev Workflow

Claim an environment from the pool:
```
‚ùØ claim_bosh_lite
Claiming 'distaffs'...
Writing out .envrc...
Pushing reservation to capi-env-pool...
Use 'target_bosh distaffs' to set bosh environment variables.
```

Observe that you successfully claimed the environment:
```
‚ùØ print_env_info
Rounding up claimed environments...

* ENV *      * CLAIMED BY *  * CLAIMED ON *                  * CLAIMED SINCE *
apologia     Tim Downey      tdowney.hostname                3 weeks ago
distaffs     Greg Cobb       gcobb.hostname                  2 minutes ago
riskier      Greg Cobb       gcobb.hostname                  13 days ago
zoned        Seth Boyles     capi-ws-cc-203                  3 weeks ago
```

Set bosh environment variables in your shell to "target" that environment:
```
‚ùØ target_bosh distaffs

Refreshing bosh lite pool state...
Already up to date.

Sourcing /.../capi-env-pool/bosh-lites/claimed/distaffs to set bosh environment variables...

```

Log in to the environment with the `cf` CLI:
```
‚ùØ target_cf

space:          space
```

Deploy the cf-deployment and capi-release versions from your dev machine:
```
‚ùØ deploy
Uploading new release to 35.185.252.196.

Syncing bosh blobs...
bosh sync-blobs
...

Creating bosh release...
create-release --force --name capi
...

Uploading release to bosh director...
bosh upload-release --rebase
...

Deploying uploaded release...
bosh deploy cf-deployment.yml -o...
...
Succeeded
```

Make local changes and deploy a new CAPI version:
```
‚ùØ deploy_only_new_capi
Building a new CAPI from local filesystem and deploying to 35.185.252.196.
bosh deploy <(bosh manifest) -o ...use-created-capi.yml ...
...

```

Release the environment for deletion, once you are done with it:
```
‚ùØ unclaim_bosh_lite riskier
Refreshing bosh lite pool state...
Hit enter to release 'riskier'
rm 'riskier/.envrc'
Pushing the release commit to capi-env-pool...
Done!
```

## Automated Workstation Setup

If you want, there are also some opinionated scripts you can run to set up a
new computer for CAPI development. These may be useful if you are dynamically
provisioning remote workstations, or something like that.

### Dependencies
* MacOS
* pip

### Running the Installer

```
    mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace
    git clone git@github.com:cloudfoundry/capi-workspace.git && cd capi-workspace
```

You can now either install via `./install.sh` or `./install-core.sh`.

Or curl the bootstrap script, which will create the `workspace` directory and clone this repo for you.
This is primarily intended for quickly setting up virtual workstations.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/capi-workspace/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

## Manual steps (to be automated later)
* Open System Preferences / Users & Groups / <user> / Login Items
    * Add `flycut` from Applications
    * Add `spectacle` from Applications
* Log out/Log in
    * This will cause Flycut and Spectacle to run and ask for permissions
* Open up Rubymine manually and enter a `License Server`
* Install the `mine` cli shortcut (RubyMine -> Tools -> Create Command-line Launcher...)
* If you are using Goland do the same two previous steps for Goland
* If you have access to the private CAPI backlog, add a secure note called `tracker_api_token` to LastPass with your Pivotal Tracker API token. This token will be used in scripts such as `claim_bosh_lite` to pull story titles currently in flight.

## Contributing to this repo

* kindly consider when a change is worth making to `install-core.sh` versus `install.sh`.
* [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) We use bash-it to organize and streamline our bash settings. This includes stuff like color schemes, aliases, shell settings, and the shell prompt formatting. Adding "plugins" to `custom-bash-it-plugins` will cause them to be installed in every new shell.

## What this installation does

`install-core.sh`: intended to be more friendly for developers who don't want this repository to take over their machine. This is intended to be the minimal set of things required for working with a CAPI repository.
* Only installs core utilities, languages, services, and binaries.
* Is NOT responsible for installing & configuring any editors (nvim/vscode/intellij)
* Is NOT responsible for installing tools for improving developer workflows (jq/rg)
* Is NOT responsible for applying any git configuration
* Is NOT responsible for loading in scripts that need to be `source`'d.
* Is NOT responsible for modifying your `$PATH` to include `script`

`./install.sh`: runs `install-core.sh` and configures the machine with many more packages/preferences

## install.sh or install-core.sh ?

`install-core.sh` is a subset of `install.sh` and is intended to be less invasive to the machine, without compromising on provisioning a workstation suitable to working on CAPI projects.

For fresh workstations && full-time CAPI developers, install.sh might make more sense.

For folks working on multiple projects, `install-core.sh` might make more sense.

For folks with existing workstations & configuration, `install-core.sh` might make more sense.
